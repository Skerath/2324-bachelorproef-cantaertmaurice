# Areas of improvements
Topics/areas which were left out to have a thesis specifically targetting a use case and possible future research possibilities.

## Literature study / literatuurstudie
- Why should work be offloaded to a back-end API rather than on-device? + possible privacy complications
- Is on-device AI capabilities possible and scalable now for this specific use case?
- expand on how LLMs can be improved: in-context learning & RAG algorithm
- What are the specific steps to train your own LLM and computer vision algorithm? -> how are the already specified algorithms used in these steps?
- How much data is required to generate accurate results?

## Proof-of-concept
- Training of your own LLM & computer vision model + steps on how it is done

# Possible future research:
- integrating biometric data from smartwatches and smart ring wearables to calculate how taxing specific exercises are on the user
- allowing the user to highlight certain spots on the body which feel tense & other post-exercise comments, possible integrations with AI
- comparing your own trained data set targetting sports vs generic allround datasets & analysing accuracy for this specific use case
